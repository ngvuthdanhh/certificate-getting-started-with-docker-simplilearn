# üê≥ Introduction to Docker

## What is Docker?
- Docker is a **containerization platform** that packages applications with dependencies into portable units.  
- Ensures consistency across environments (dev, test, prod).  

## Why Containers?
- Lightweight compared to VMs.  
- Fast startup and resource-efficient.  
- Portable and scalable.  

## Benefits of Docker
- **Consistency**: Works the same everywhere.  
- **Isolation**: Apps run independently.  
- **Efficiency**: Smaller resource footprint.  
- **Scalability**: Easy to scale horizontally.
