# ✅ Best Practices with Docker

1. Use official base images when possible.  
2. Keep images small by minimizing layers.  
3. Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files.  
4. Tag images properly (`myapp:v1.0`).  
5. Don’t run processes as root in containers.  
6. Use volumes for persistent data.  
7. Regularly scan images for vulnerabilities.
